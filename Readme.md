### üôè Kindly Note
Due to time constraints, the Postman collection may be missing or incomplete.  
We kindly invite you to use the integrated **Swagger Documentation** to explore and interact with the API.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.


## üîß Environment Configuration

All necessary environment variables are already registered directly in the `docker-compose.yml` file.  
This setup is designed to help reviewers launch the project effortlessly without manual configuration.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment Note

If you plan to deploy this project in a production environment, **do not use environment variables directly inside `docker-compose.yml`**.  
Instead, follow one of these best practices:

- Use a `.env` file and reference variables using `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax.
- Configure environment variables directly in your deployment environment (e.g., CI/CD, cloud provider, or secrets manager).
- Use tools like [Docker secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) or Spring Boot config servers to manage sensitive information securely.

**üõ°Ô∏è Keep credentials and sensitive values out of source control.**
